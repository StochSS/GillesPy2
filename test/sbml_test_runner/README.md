# Running the SBML Compliance Tests  
  
In order to verify SBML compliance with the GillesPy2 package, follow these steps.  
  
### 1. Install the [SBML Test Suite](http://sbml.org/Software/SBML_Test_Suite)  
  
### 2. Configure wrappers. 
While running the SBML Test Suite, go to File->Options/Wrappers  
The wrappers for gillespy2 solvers are contained [here: /test/sbml_test_runner/wrappers ](/test/sbml_test_runner/wrappers)  
Provide the path for the desired wrapper along with a name.
Be sure to configure all arguments to the wrapper.  
The 'arguments to wrapper' field should contain:  
``` %d %n %o %l %v```  
or for debug to stdout:  
``` %d %n %o %l %v -d```  
  
You can provide any output directory you desire.

### 3. In the file for the wrapper you are using, be sure to append your GillesPy2 directory to the system path

### 4. Save, and begin running test cases.  Additional documentation can be found at [the SBML site](http://sbml.org/Software/SBML_Test_Suite) or [the SBML github repo](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite/)
