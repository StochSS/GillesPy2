Examples of using GillesPy2
===========================

The files in this directory are runnable Python examples of using [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2) to perform stochastic simulation.  In terms of biology, they are overly simplistic and do not capture the real-life complexity of the process being modeled &ndash; the aim is not biological realism but rather to illustrate basic usage of [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2).

* [Getting Started](Getting-Started.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating the use of GillesPy2 on a simple Michaelis-Menten model
* [Basic Examples](BasicExamples) &ndash; numerous basic examples, in the form of standalone Python files and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* [Advanced Examples](AdvancedExamples) &ndash; examples illustrating more complicated models or features
* [SBML]() &ndash; examples and tests of reading models in [SBML](http://sbml.org) format
* [Speed Comparisons](SpeedComparisons) &ndash; time comparison of different solvers
