Examples of using GillesPy2
===========================

The files in this directory are runnable Python examples of using [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2) to perform stochastic simulation.  In terms of biology, they are overly simplistic and do not capture the real-life complexity of the process being modeled &ndash; the aim is not biological realism but rather to illustrate basic usage of [GillesPy2](https://github.com/gillesPy2/GillesPy2).

* [Start Here](StartHere.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating the use of GillesPy2 on a simple Michaelis-Menten model

* [Starting Models](StartingModels) &ndash; numerous basic files and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), showcasing all GillesPy2 solvers on two data sets, as well as speed comparisons  

* [Advanced Features](AdvancedFeatures) &ndash; examples illustrating more complicated models or features, including how to import SBML files

* [Extra Models](ExtraModels) &ndash; various extra models and files

* [Data Visualization](DataVisualization) &ndash; contains files and [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating various methods of visualizing data with GillesPy2
