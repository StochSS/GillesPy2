Documentation for GillesPy2 |release|
#####################################

GillesPy2 is an open-source Python package for stochastic simulation of biochemical systems.  It offers an object-oriented approach for creating mathematical models of biological systems, as well as a variety of methods for performing time simulation of those models.  The methods include the `Gillespie direct method (SSA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm>`_, several variant stochastic simulation methods including `tau leaping <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau-leaping>`_, and numerical integration of ODEs.  The solvers support a variety of user environments, with optimized code for C++, `Cython <https://cython.org>`_, and `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_.  Models can also be read from files in `SBML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBML>`_ format.
